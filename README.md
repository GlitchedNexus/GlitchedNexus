Hello, I'm @GlitchedNexus, also known as Raghav Awasthi.

I hold the conviction that technology is the pivotal force capable of transforming our world, and it's my goal to explore the furthest reaches of our existence through it.

My current focus is on an ambitious endeavor aimed at converting the intricate aspects of human consciousness into a form understandable by computers. This project, coupled with my intense fascination with the enigmas surrounding life beyond Earth and its unique biochemistry, underscores my dedication to advancing the frontiers of science and technology. I am passionate about innovation and consistently seek opportunities to deploy my abilities in projects that are both challenging and impactful.

I am open and encouraging to anyone driven by a similar vision and eager to contribute to this transformative journey.
