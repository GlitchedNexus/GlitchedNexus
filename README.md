Hi, Iâ€™m @GlitchedNexus (A.K.A. Raghav Awasthi). 

I believe that technology is the only thing that can change the world
and it is my ambition ot help unlock the outer limits of our existance. 

Over my lifetime I intend to bring my ideal to life and create technology
that will make the world a better place using the fusion of computer science
and the classical science (mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry).

I welcome and support anyone who is interested in bringing this vision to life.
