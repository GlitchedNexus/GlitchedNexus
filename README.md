Hi, Iâ€™m @GlitchedNexus (A.K.A. Raghav Awasthi). 

I believe that technology is the only thing that can change the world
and it is my ambition ot help unlock the outer limits of our existance. 

I'm deeply involved in a personal venture that seeks to translate the
complexities of human consciousness into computational language. 
This ambitious project, along with my keen interest in the mysteries 
of extraterrestrial life and biochemistry, reflects my commitment to 
pushing the boundaries of science and technology. I thrive on innovation 
and am always eager to apply my skills to challenging and meaningful projects.

I welcome and support anyone who is interested in bringing this vision to life.
