I’m Raghav, or Glitched Nexus as some of you may know me.

I hold the conviction that technology is the pivotal force capable of transforming our world, 
and it's my goal to help push humanity to our full potential. I love distributed systems, 
artificial intelligence and pretty UI.

I have always been fascinated by science-fiction and hope to one day help develop technology 
that lets us integrate machines into our biology. I am also enthralled by drones and their 
versatility which makes them useful in all areas of society. I’m particularly 
interested in using drone clusters for mapping geography and data acquisition.

Also, I love cute and fluffy stuff.
